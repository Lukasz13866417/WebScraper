Assembly language, 0.95%, 17, 14, -0.24%, ↓ 
 ### Summary of Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language closely tied to the machine code specific to computer architectures, utilizing mnemonic codes to represent operations that a processor executes. It serves as a bridge between high-level languages and binary code, allowing for direct hardware manipulation while providing a more human-readable format than raw binary. Although the use of assembly language has declined with the advent of higher-level programming languages, it remains relevant for performance optimization, embedded systems, and critical hardware interactions, particularly in specialized fields like operating system development and real-time applications. 
 ## Summary of Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that acts as an interface between high-level languages and machine code, closely related to a computer's hardware architecture. It simplifies the task of programming by using mnemonic codes to represent machine instructions, making it more human-readable compared to raw binary code. Each processor architecture has its own assembly language, reflecting specific commands that the hardware can execute directly.

### Key Features of Assembly Language
- **Mnemonics:** Each assembly instruction is represented by a mnemonic, such as `MOV` for data transfer and `ADD` for addition.
- **Operands:** These specify the data or addresses upon which the operations are performed.
- **Direct Control:** Assembly allows programmers to control hardware directly, making it ideal for systems programming, such as device drivers and operating systems.
- **Assemblers:** Assembly code is translated into machine language by an assembler, which can operate in either one or multiple passes through the source code.

### Evolution
Assembly language evolved alongside computer technology, starting from the first generation of vacuum tube-based computers to modern microprocessors. Early assembly languages were simple, but they evolved to include features like macros, symbolic labels, and structured programming to enhance productivity and readability.

### Current Usage
While the majority of software development now relies on high-level languages, assembly language is still necessary for performance-critical applications, real-time systems, firmware, and tasks requiring close hardware manipulation. It remains relevant in embedded systems programming and is sometimes used to optimize performance in specific segments, like cryptographic algorithms or game engines.

### Advantages and Disadvantages
#### Advantages:

COBOL, 0.82%, 18, 19, -0.18%, ↑ 
 COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), developed in the late 1950s for business data processing, features a verbose, English-like syntax designed to be understandable by non-programmers, and has been extensively standardized over the decades. Although originally perceived as a legacy language, it remains critical in sectors like finance and government, handling a significant portion of banking transactions and administrative systems, especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Modern adaptations of COBOL have incorporated object-oriented programming features, but its continued importance highlights the challenge of maintaining and upgrading long-standing technologies in contemporary computing environments. 
 # Summary of COBOL

COBOL, which stands for "Common Business-Oriented Language," is a high-level programming language primarily designed for business data processing. Developed in 1959 by a consortium known as CODASYL as part of a U.S. Department of Defense initiative, COBOL's verbose, English-like syntax makes it self-documenting and accessible to non-programmers. The language is structured into four main divisions: Identification, Environment, Data, and Procedure divisions, which facilitate a clear separation of concerns.

The language has undergone several revisions, including COBOL-61, COBOL-68, COBOL-74, and COBOL-85, with the latest standard being COBOL 2023. While known for its stability and reliability, COBOL has faced criticism for its verbosity and lack of modern programming structures, which can lead to complex codebases. Despite these challenges, COBOL remains embedded in many legacy systems, handling a significant portion of global financial transactions, including 95% of ATM transactions and over 40% of online banking systems.

Currently, organizations are struggling to find COBOL programmers, especially as many legacy systems still rely on this language. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this issue when certain state unemployment systems, still running on COBOL, faced challenges due to a shortage of skilled programmers. COBOL continues to adapt, introducing object-oriented features to remain relevant in modern software development while maintaining its core functionality suited for business applications.

In summary, while COBOL may be viewed as outdated by some, its practical application in high-stakes business environments ensures its ongoing relevance in the technology landscape. As more organizations seek to modernize their systems, the need for skilled COBOL developers is likely to persist.

Prolog, 0.80%, 20, 24, +0.03%, ⇑ 
 Prolog is a logic programming language primarily used for artificial intelligence applications, allowing developers to express logic as facts and rules. Its declarative nature enables automatic inference of solutions based on specified relationships, which is beneficial in handling uncertain or incomplete information. Prolog's strengths include easy database creation, recursive search capabilities, and built-in list handling, though it may have limitations compared to other languages, particularly in I/O features. 
 # Overview of Prolog

Prolog (Programming in Logic) is a **declarative programming language** primarily used in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational linguistics. Unlike procedural languages, Prolog focuses on expressing relationships using facts and rules, allowing for automatic inference of solutions through logical reasoning.

## Key Characteristics
- **Facts and Rules**: Prolog programs consist of facts (basic assertions about the domain) and rules (logical statements that create relationships between facts). For example:
  ```prolog
  man(john).
  woman(mary).
  not(X,Y) :- man(X), woman(Y).
  ```
  In this snippet, `man(john)` states that John is a man, while the rule describes that if X is a man and Y is a woman, then X is not Y.

- **Queries**: Users can query the knowledge base to infer conclusions or check for truths in the defined relationships:
  ```prolog
  ?- not(john, mary).
  ```
  This query checks whether John is not Mary based on the available facts.

## Features
- **Unification**: Prolog matches terms to determine if they can represent the same structure.
- **Backtracking**: When a query fails, Prolog automatically retraces steps to find alternative solutions.
- **Recursion**: This is a fundamental feature in Prolog that supports complex searches.

## Strengths and Limitations
### Advantages:
1. **Declarative Nature**: Easier to build databases and defines logic without extensive programming efforts.
2. **Pattern Matching**: Prolog excels in tasks involving recursion and list manipulation, crucial for algorithmic processes.
3. **Flexible Handling of Information**: Capable of reasoning over incomplete or uncertain data.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Less Popularity**: Compared to languages like LISP, Prolog has fewer I/O features and less community support.
2. **Complex Syntax**: Some users find Prolog's syntax less straightforward than imperative languages.

## Applications in AI
Prolog is extensively used for applications that involve logic-based reasoning, such as:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Parsing and understanding language structures.
- **Expert Systems**: Implementing rules for decision-making in medical diagnostics and other domains.

## Current Relevance
Despite its niche use, Prolog remains pertinent in fields relying on AI and knowledge representation. It not only serves educational purposes but also supports intricate AI systems and research projects.

For practical usage, several interpreters such as SWI-Prolog and GNU Prolog are available for installation, allowing users to create and run Prolog programs with ease. Overall, Prolog's unique capabilities enable developers to explore complex problems where logic and inference are pivotal.
