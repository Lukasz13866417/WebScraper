# COBOL

## Overview

COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), developed in the late 1950s for business data processing, features a verbose, English-like syntax designed to be understandable by non-programmers, and has been extensively standardized over the decades. Although originally perceived as a legacy language, it remains critical in sectors like finance and government, handling a significant portion of banking transactions and administrative systems, especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Modern adaptations of COBOL have incorporated object-oriented programming features, but its continued importance highlights the challenge of maintaining and upgrading long-standing technologies in contemporary computing environments.

# Summary of COBOL

COBOL, which stands for "Common Business-Oriented Language," is a high-level programming language primarily designed for business data processing. Developed in 1959 by a consortium known as CODASYL as part of a U.S. Department of Defense initiative, COBOL's verbose, English-like syntax makes it self-documenting and accessible to non-programmers. The language is structured into four main divisions: Identification, Environment, Data, and Procedure divisions, which facilitate a clear separation of concerns.

The language has undergone several revisions, including COBOL-61, COBOL-68, COBOL-74, and COBOL-85, with the latest standard being COBOL 2023. While known for its stability and reliability, COBOL has faced criticism for its verbosity and lack of modern programming structures, which can lead to complex codebases. Despite these challenges, COBOL remains embedded in many legacy systems, handling a significant portion of global financial transactions, including 95% of ATM transactions and over 40% of online banking systems.

Currently, organizations are struggling to find COBOL programmers, especially as many legacy systems still rely on this language. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this issue when certain state unemployment systems, still running on COBOL, faced challenges due to a shortage of skilled programmers. COBOL continues to adapt, introducing object-oriented features to remain relevant in modern software development while maintaining its core functionality suited for business applications.

In summary, while COBOL may be viewed as outdated by some, its practical application in high-stakes business environments ensures its ongoing relevance in the technology landscape. As more organizations seek to modernize their systems, the need for skilled COBOL developers is likely to persist.
