# Fortran

## Overview

Fortran, a third-generation programming language developed by IBM in the 1950s, stands for "Formula Translation" and was initially crafted for numeric computation and scientific applications. Over the decades, it has evolved through multiple versions—such as Fortran 77, 90, 95, and the recent Fortran 2023—integrating features like structured programming, modular programming, and object-oriented programming, thus maintaining relevance in high-performance computing sectors. Despite often being regarded as outdated, Fortran still boasts a dedicated user base in scientific and engineering fields, continually receiving updates to address modern computational needs.

## Detailed Information

# Summary of Fortran

Fortran, short for **Formula Translating System**, is a high-level, compiled programming language first developed by IBM in the 1950s, specifically for scientific and engineering applications. Its initial version, Fortran I, became operational in 1957, and it has undergone significant evolution through various standard versions, including Fortran 77, Fortran 90, Fortran 95, and the latest, Fortran 2023, released in November 2023.

## Historical Context
- Developed by John Backus and his team, Fortran was among the first high-level programming languages and set standards for compiler optimization.
- It gained popularity in scientific computing due to its ability to efficiently handle numeric computations and was the first to support complex data types, such as arrays and character strings from Fortran 77 onward.

## Language Features
Fortran has evolved to include:
- **Structured and Modular Programming**: Supports function and subroutine definitions.
- **Array Programming**: Facilitates manipulation of large datasets.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Introduced in Fortran 2003, enabling encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Concurrent Programming**: Fortran 2008 introduced constructs for parallel execution, highlighting its suitability for high-performance computing applications.

## Modern Usage
- Fortran remains integral in domains like computational fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and numerical analysis. Its powerful features allow the development of complex scientific models, which makes it indispensable in supercomputing environments.
- As of April 2024, Fortran has been listed among the top ten programming languages according to the TIOBE index, reflecting its ongoing relevance.

## Syntax Overview
Fortran emphasizes a clear structure, where variables are defined upfront, and specific types (e.g., INTEGER, REAL, LOGICAL) are required. Each program generally starts with the `PROGRAM` keyword and ends with `END PROGRAM`, with logical flow controlled by constructs like `IF...THEN...ELSE`.

## Compilation and Execution
Fortran uses a traditional compilation process. Code must be translated into machine-readable format before execution, differing from interpreted languages like Python. As of recent standards, the language has improved its interoperability with C, enabling the use of extensive C libraries in Fortran programs.

In summary, Fortran's blend of historic significance and modern capabilities makes it a vital language in the scientific computing landscape, optimized for high-performance applications while continuously adapting to current programming paradigms.
