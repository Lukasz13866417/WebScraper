# The Rise of Fast Programming Languages

Now that the world needs to crunch more and more numbers per second, and hardware is not evolving fast enough, the speed of programs is becoming increasingly important. It is not surprising that fast programming languages are gaining ground in the TIOBE index. 

- **C++** recently climbed to position 2.
- **Go** has established itself as a steady top 10 player.
- **Rust** is at an all-time high with a share of **1.47%**.
- Meanwhile, fast languages **Mojo** and **Zig** are knocking on the top 50's door, sitting at positions **#51** and **#56**, respectively.

## The Python Phenomenon

You might wonder how **Python**, often labeled as a slow language, manages to hold its ground next to these speed monsters. The answer lies in a different driver of language popularity: **ease of learning**. 

While the world requires more capable programs, it also needs more programmers. Developing applications entirely with AI is not yet feasible, leading to a continued high demand for new programmers. With the number of graduated software engineers falling short of industry needs, many non-software engineers are joining the programming bandwagon, with **Python** becoming their language of choice. This is a primary reason why Python is here to stay.

## Understanding the TIOBE Index

The TIOBE Programming Community Index serves as an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. Updated monthly, the ratings are based on several factors, including:

- The number of skilled engineers worldwide.
- Available courses.
- Third-party vendors.

Popular websites such as Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing, and more than 20 others are used to calculate these ratings. 

It is important to note that the TIOBE index does not measure the best programming language or the one with the most lines of code. Instead, it can serve as a tool to check whether your programming skills are still current or help make strategic decisions about which programming language to adopt when starting a new software project.
