Starting. Scraping TIOBE
TIOBE data scraped
Basic info scraped: 
 Now that the world needs to crunch more and more numbers per second, and hardware is not evolving fast enough, speed of programs is getting important. Having said this, it is not surprising that the fast programming languages are gaining ground in the TIOBE index. Programming language C++ climbed to position 2 recently, Go has become a steady top 10 player, and Rust is at an all-time high of 1.47%. Moreover, fast languages Mojo and Zig are knocking on the top 50 door at positions #51 and #56, respectively.
You might wonder how Python, known as a slow language, is able to survive next to these race monsters. This is because there is another driver nowadays except for performance: how easy is it to learn a new programming language. Apart from crunching more numbers, the world also needs more programmers. Developing applications completely in AI is not possible yet. Hence, the demand for new programmers is still very high. Since the number of graduated software engineers is lower than is needed, all kind of non-software engineers are jumping on the programming bandwagon, and their favorite language is Python. This is why Python is here to stay.
The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.
The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.

This is because there is another driver nowadays except for performance: how easy is it to learn a new programming language. Apart from crunching more numbers, the world also needs more programmers. Developing applications completely in AI is not possible yet. Hence, the demand for new programmers is still very high. Since the number of graduated software engineers is lower than is needed, all kind of non-software engineers are jumping on the programming bandwagon, and their favorite language is Python. This is why Python is here to stay.
The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.
The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.

TIOBE data scraped
Basic info scraped: 
 Now that the world needs to crunch more and more numbers per second, and hardware is not evolving fast enough, speed of programs is getting important. Having said this, it is not surprising that the fast programming languages are gaining ground in the TIOBE index. Programming language C++ climbed to position 2 recently, Go has become a steady top 10 player, and Rust is at an all-time high of 1.47%. Moreover, fast languages Mojo and Zig are knocking on the top 50 door at positions #51 and #56, respectively.

# The Rise of Fast Programming Languages

As the world demands an increasing amount of processing power, the speed at which programs run is becoming crucial. With hardware not evolving rapidly enough, it's no surprise that fast programming languages are gaining popularity in the TIOBE index. Notably:

- **C++** has recently climbed to position 2.
- **Go** has secured a steady presence in the top 10.
- **Rust** is at an all-time high of **1.47%**.
- **Mojo** and **Zig** are also making waves, positioned at #51 and #56, respectively.

## The Case for Python

You might wonder how **Python**, often labeled as a slower language, continues to thrive alongside these high-speed contenders. The answer lies in an important factor beyond performance: **ease of learning a new programming language**. 

While the world requires more efficient data processing, it also has an ongoing need for an increasing number of programmers. Currently, developing applications solely through AI is not feasible, which keeps the demand for new software engineers high. Since the number of graduates in this field is not meeting demand, engineers from other backgrounds are embracing programming, with Python being their language of choice. This trend is why Python remains a staple in the programming community.

## The TIOBE Index Explained

The **TIOBE Programming Community Index** serves as a gauge for the popularity of programming languages. Updated monthly, the index relies on various metrics, including:

- The number of skilled engineers worldwide
- The availability of courses
- The presence of third-party vendors

It aggregates data from many popular websites such as **Google**, **Amazon**, **Wikipedia**, and **Bing**, among others. 

It’s important to note that the TIOBE index does not determine the "best" programming language or identify the language with the most lines of code.

### Use of the TIOBE Index

The TIOBE index can help developers assess whether their programming skills are current or assist in making strategic decisions when selecting a programming language for new software development projects. 

For more details, you can find the [definition of the TIOBE index here](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

- **Go:** Established a solid place in the top 10.
- **Rust:** Reached an all-time high of 1.47%.
- **Mojo** and **Zig:** Approaching the top 50, currently positioned at #51 and #56, respectively.

## Python's Resilience

You might be curious about how **Python**, often regarded as a slower language, continues to thrive alongside these performance-driven languages. The key factor is that alongside performance, there is another critical driver today: **ease of learning** a new programming language. 

As the world requires more programmers, the demand for capable individuals is at an all-time high. Despite advancements in AI, fully developing applications is still not feasible. Because the supply of graduated software engineers is insufficient to meet this demand, many non-software engineers are transitioning to programming, and their language of choice is often Python. This trend suggests that Python is likely here to stay.

## Understanding the TIOBE Index

The **TIOBE Programming Community index** serves as an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. It is updated monthly and relies on various metrics including:

- The number of skilled engineers worldwide.

TIOBE data scraped
Basic info scraped: 
 # The Rise of Fast Programming Languages

As the world demands greater computational power, the speed of programs has become increasingly important. Interestingly, this trend is reflected in the TIOBE index, which ranks programming languages based on their popularity. 

## Trending Languages

- **C++**: Recently climbed to the 2nd position.
- **Go**: Established itself as a consistent top 10 player.
- **Rust**: Reached an all-time high of 1.47%.
- **Mojo**: Currently at position #51.
- **Zig**: Just behind Mojo at position #56.

### The Python Paradox

You may wonder how **Python**, often criticized for its performance, continues to thrive alongside these high-speed languages. The answer lies not just in speed but also in accessibility. As the demand for programmers rises, many non-software engineers are turning to programming, and Python is a popular choice due to its ease of learning. 

Despite the proliferation of high-performance languages, there is still a significant need for new developers, especially as developing applications solely through AI remains a distant goal. Consequently, Python's position in the programming ecosystem remains secure.

## Understanding the TIOBE Index

The **TIOBE Programming Community Index** serves as an indicator of programming language popularity. It is updated monthly and based on factors such as:

- The number of skilled engineers worldwide
- Educational courses
- Third-party vendors

The ratings also rely on data from popular websites including Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, and Bing, among others.

### Key Points About the TIOBE Index:

- **Not a Quality Measure**: The index does not signify the best programming language or the one with the most lines of code written.
- **Skill Assessment**: It serves as a tool to gauge whether your programming skills are up to date.
- **Strategic Decisions**: It can aid in making strategic decisions regarding which programming language to adopt when starting a new software project.

For more information on the definition and methodology of the TIOBE index, feel free to check [here](#).

# The Evolving Landscape of Programming Languages

As the world increasingly demands the ability to process more and more numbers per second, the speed of programs has become a critical factor. With hardware not evolving fast enough, it's no surprise that faster programming languages are gaining traction in the TIOBE index. For instance:

- **C++** recently climbed to position 2.
- **Go** has established itself as a consistent top 10 player.
- **Rust** has reached an all-time high of 1.47%.
- New contenders, **Mojo** and **Zig**, are knocking on the top 50 door, currently positioned at #51 and #56, respectively.

## The Python Paradox

You might wonder how **Python**, often labeled as a slower language, continues to thrive alongside these high-performance languages. The answer lies in a crucial factor beyond just performance: the ease of learning a new programming language. 

As the world strives to crunch more numbers, the demand for *more programmers* has skyrocketed. Given that developing fully AI-driven applications is not yet feasible, the need for human programmers remains high. Furthermore, the number of graduates in software engineering is not keeping pace with this demand, prompting non-software engineers to join the programming community. Unsurprisingly, their language of choice tends to be **Python**, which explains its enduring popularity.

## The TIOBE Programming Community Index

The TIOBE Programming Community Index serves as an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. Updated monthly, the ratings are based on various factors:

- The number of skilled engineers worldwide
- Educational courses
- Third-party vendors

Prominent websites such as **Google**, **Amazon**, **Wikipedia**, **Bing**, and over 20 others contribute to calculating these ratings. 

It's important to note that the TIOBE index does not measure the "best" programming language or the one with the most lines of code written.

## Using the TIOBE Index

The index can be invaluable for:

- Checking whether your programming skills are up to date
- Making strategic decisions on which programming language to adopt when starting a new software project

For a more detailed definition of the TIOBE index, you can find it [here](#).

# The Importance of Fast Programming Languages

As the world demands more and more processing power, the speed of programming languages is becoming increasingly crucial. With hardware not evolving quickly enough to meet these demands, it's no surprise that fast programming languages are climbing the ranks in the TIOBE index. Notably:

- **C++** has recently risen to position **2**.
- **Go** has established itself as a steady player in the **top 10**.
- **Rust** is at an all-time high of **1.47%**.
- Emerging fast languages **Mojo** and **Zig** are knocking on the top 50 door at positions **#51** and **#56**, respectively.

## Python's Resilience

You might wonder how **Python**, often labeled as a slow programming language, continues to thrive alongside these speedsters. The answer lies in another vital factor: **ease of learning**. 

In addition to crunching numbers, the world has an ongoing need for more programmers. Fully developing applications using AI alone isn't feasible yet, which keeps the demand for new programmers high. Since the number of graduates in software engineering does not meet the required supply, many non-software engineers are taking up programming, with Python being their language of choice. This popularity reinforces the notion that Python is here to stay.

## Understanding the TIOBE Index

The **TIOBE Programming Community Index** serves as an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. Updated monthly, the ratings are based on:

- The number of skilled engineers worldwide.
- The availability of courses and third-party vendors.
- Data from popular websites including **Google**, **Amazon**, **Wikipedia**, **Bing**, and over **20** others.

It's important to note that the TIOBE index does not reflect which programming language is the "best" or the one with the most lines of code written.

## Utilizing the TIOBE Index

The TIOBE index can be a helpful tool for checking if your programming skills are up to date. Additionally, it can guide strategic decisions about which programming languages to adopt when starting to build a new software system. 

For more information, you can find the definition of the TIOBE index [here](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

### Important Notes

It's essential to understand that the TIOBE index does not measure which programming language is the "best" or the one with the most lines of code written. Instead, it can be a valuable tool for:

- Checking if your programming skills are up to date
- Making strategic decisions about which programming language to adopt when starting a new software system

Then add high-level programming constructs such as conditional statements and loops. You can run your script as an entire program or divide it into sections that can be run individually. With the Live Editor, you can create a script that is an executable notebook with output and visualizations next to the code that produced them. Use formatted text, headings, equations, images, and hyperlinks to document your work then share it with others.Combine commands to create a script (left). Use the Live Editor to create an executable notebook (right).Learn moreProgramming and ScriptsCreate and Run Sections in CodeWhat Is the Live Editor?(2:20)Write Reusable FunctionsYou can use functions to break down a complicated program into smaller, reusable parts. You can automatically refactor code in scripts into reusable functions. Functions can have optional, named arguments to make them easier to use. Function argument validation eliminates the need to write complex input error checking code. You can use language features that enable your functions to manage and recover from errors.Learn moreHow to Create a MATLAB Function(9:01)Functions with Multiple Inputs or Outputs(3:22)Function Argument ValidationWrite functions with multiple inputs and outputs (top). Use function argument validation to make functions more robust (bottom).Write functions with multiple inputs and outputs (top). Use function argument validation to make functions more robust (bottom).Use object-oriented programming to model real-world objects and manage software complexity.Use object-oriented programming to model real-world objects and manage software complexity.Author Custom ClassesWith object-oriented programming, you can defineobjectsthat combine data (properties) with functions that operate on that data (methods). You can use objects to model the behavior of devices and systems in the real world and organize code into components that are easier to maintain and extend.A MATLABclassdefines a set of instructions used to build a specific type of object.
