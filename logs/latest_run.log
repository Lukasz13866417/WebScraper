Starting. Scraping TIOBE
TIOBE data scraped
Basic info scraped: 
 Now that the world needs to crunch more and more numbers per second, and hardware is not evolving fast enough, speed of programs is getting important. Having said this, it is not surprising that the fast programming languages are gaining ground in the TIOBE index. Programming language C++ climbed to position 2 recently, Go has become a steady top 10 player, and Rust is at an all-time high of 1.47%. Moreover, fast languages Mojo and Zig are knocking on the top 50 door at positions #51 and #56, respectively.
You might wonder how Python, known as a slow language, is able to survive next to these race monsters. This is because there is another driver nowadays except for performance: how easy is it to learn a new programming language. Apart from crunching more numbers, the world also needs more programmers. Developing applications completely in AI is not possible yet. Hence, the demand for new programmers is still very high. Since the number of graduated software engineers is lower than is needed, all kind of non-software engineers are jumping on the programming bandwagon, and their favorite language is Python. This is why Python is here to stay.
The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.
The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.

Moreover, fast languages Mojo and Zig are knocking on the top 50 door at positions #51 and #56, respectively.
You might wonder how Python, known as a slow language, is able to survive next to these race monsters. This is because there is another driver nowadays except for performance: how easy is it to learn a new programming language. Apart from crunching more numbers, the world also needs more programmers. Developing applications completely in AI is not possible yet. Hence, the demand for new programmers is still very high. Since the number of graduated software engineers is lower than is needed, all kind of non-software engineers are jumping on the programming bandwagon, and their favorite language is Python. This is why Python is here to stay.
The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.
The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.

TIOBE data scraped
Basic info scraped: 
 Now that the world needs to crunch more and more numbers per second, and hardware is not evolving fast enough, speed of programs is getting important. Having said this, it is not surprising that the fast programming languages are gaining ground in the TIOBE index. Programming language C++ climbed to position 2 recently, Go has become a steady top 10 player, and Rust is at an all-time high of 1.47%. Moreover, fast languages Mojo and Zig are knocking on the top 50 door at positions #51 and #56, respectively.

# The Rise of Fast Programming Languages

As the world demands an increasing amount of processing power, the speed at which programs run is becoming crucial. With hardware not evolving rapidly enough, it's no surprise that fast programming languages are gaining popularity in the TIOBE index. Notably:

- **C++** has recently climbed to position 2.
- **Go** has secured a steady presence in the top 10.
- **Rust** is at an all-time high of **1.47%**.
- **Mojo** and **Zig** are also making waves, positioned at #51 and #56, respectively.

## The Case for Python

You might wonder how **Python**, often labeled as a slower language, continues to thrive alongside these high-speed contenders. The answer lies in an important factor beyond performance: **ease of learning a new programming language**. 

While the world requires more efficient data processing, it also has an ongoing need for an increasing number of programmers. Currently, developing applications solely through AI is not feasible, which keeps the demand for new software engineers high. Since the number of graduates in this field is not meeting demand, engineers from other backgrounds are embracing programming, with Python being their language of choice. This trend is why Python remains a staple in the programming community.

## The TIOBE Index Explained

The **TIOBE Programming Community Index** serves as a gauge for the popularity of programming languages. Updated monthly, the index relies on various metrics, including:

- The number of skilled engineers worldwide
- The availability of courses
- The presence of third-party vendors

It aggregates data from many popular websites such as **Google**, **Amazon**, **Wikipedia**, and **Bing**, among others. 

It’s important to note that the TIOBE index does not determine the "best" programming language or identify the language with the most lines of code.

### Use of the TIOBE Index

The TIOBE index can help developers assess whether their programming skills are current or assist in making strategic decisions when selecting a programming language for new software development projects. 

For more details, you can find the [definition of the TIOBE index here](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).
